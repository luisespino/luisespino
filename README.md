## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I hold a degree in Computer Science Engineering from the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala, and a Master's degree in Computer Science from the Instituo TecnolÃ³gico de Costa Rica.

I am a university professor, teaching courses in Artificial Intelligence, Databases, Data Structures, Computer Architecture, Computer Networks, and Compilers.

I am passionate about programming and enjoy learning new things about technology every day. I also like writing books, primarily about computer science.
